title: Udev network device names
---

Udev network device names by default change to BIOS/UEFI location based names in Debian Stretch.

```sh
/usr/share/doc/udev/README.Debian.gz
```

Read Debian's documents and if you depend on device names staying the same (firewall, scripts etc.), you can follow the advice to set up /etc/udev/rules.d/76-netnames.rules and then (re)move empty /etc/systemd/network/99-default.link if you have it (in case you upgraded).

```sh
#/etc/udev/rules.d/76-netnames.rules
#   The name of the rules file needs to have a prefix smaller than "80" so that
#   it runs before /lib/udev/rules.d/80-net-setup-link.rules, and should have a
#   prefix bigger than "75" so that it runs after 75-net-description.rules and
#   thus you can use matches on ID_VENDOR and similar properties.
## identify by vendor/model ID
#SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", ENV{ID_VENDOR_ID}=="0x8086", \
#    ENV{ID_MODEL_ID}=="0x1502", NAME="eth-intel-gb"
#
## USB device by path
## get ID_PATH if not present yet
#ENV{ID_PATH}=="", IMPORT{builtin}="path_id"
#SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", ENV{ID_PATH}=="*-usb-0:3:1*", NAME="eth-blue-hub"
# identify device by MAC address
SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", ATTR{address}=="ea:e9:8a:aa:3f:ab", NAME="lan"
SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", ATTR{address}=="aa:a2:b3:27:dd:af", NAME="wan"
```

To make the changes take effect:

```sh
sudo update-initramfs -u
```
